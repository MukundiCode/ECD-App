# WordPress Scripts (php and html)
These scripts were used to achieve key functionality such as:\
- Displaying posts assigned to a user\
- Filtering by category or language\
- Structuring these posts\
These scripts are local and therefore cannot reference pre-defined variables/functions. Therefore redundancy exists throughout the code-blocks.\
These scripts are "code-blocks" within the WordPress installation, and can be found within the structure panel within:\
i.e.:\
WordPress > Pages > Home > Edit with Oxygen Builder\
WordPress > Template > Category Archive > Edit with Oxygen Builder\
WordPress > Template > Language Archive > Edit with Oxygen Builder\
WordPress > Template > ECD Post Archive > Edit with Oxygen Builder\

# WordPress css scripts
This (global) script was used to style the custom classes referenced throughout the code-blocks
