## WordPress Scripts:
These scripts were used to achieve key functionality such as:
- Fetching posts assigned to a user.
- Designing and displaying these posts.
- Filtering by category or language.\

These scripts are placed in the "code-blocks", within the WordPress installation.\
Code-blocks are local. Therefore, these scripts cannot reference pre-defined variables or functions. Redundancy therefore exists throughout the independent code-blocks.\
These scripts are used in:
- You and Your Baby Dashboard > Pages > Home.
- You and Your Baby Dashboard > Template > Category Archive.
- You and Your Baby Dashboard > Template > Language Archive.
- You and Your Baby Dashboard > Template > ECD Post Archive.

### WordPress CSS Scripts:
This (global) script, all-styles-script.css, was used to style the custom classes referenced throughout the code-blocks.

## ECD Plugin
This plugin, ecd-plugin.php, was developed through SFTP.\
Key functionality includes:
- x2 Custom Endpoints for Mobile App to fetch.
- Web Portal customization for Authors.
- Web Portal online help and documentation.
- Small changes to native WP experience.\

Should future iterations be made, please get in touch with Bhabhisanas IT provider for these details.
